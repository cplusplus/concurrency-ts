<h1>Class <code>executor</code></h1>

<p>
Class <code>executor</code> is an abstract base class defining an abstract interface of
objects that are capable of scheduling and coordinating work submitted by
clients. Work units submitted to an executor may be executed in one or more
separate threads. Implementations are required to avoid data races when work
units are submitted concurrently.</p>

<p>
All closures are defined to execute on some thread, but which thread is largely
unspecified. As such accessing a <code>thread_local</code> variable is defined behavior,
though it is unspecified which thread's <code>thread_local</code> will be accessed.</p>

<p>
The initiation of a work unit is not necessarily ordered with respect to other
initiations. </p>
<p><cxx-note> Concrete executors may, and often do, provide stronger
initiation order guarantees. Users may, for example, obtain serial execution
guarantees by using the <code>serial_executor</code> wrapper.</cxx-note> </p>

<p>There is no defined ordering of the execution or completion of closures added to the
executor. </p>

<p>
<cxx-note> The consequence is that closures should not wait on other
closures executed by that executor. Mutual exclusion for critical sections is
fine, but it can't be used for signalling between closures. Concrete executors
may provide stronger execution order guarantees.</cxx-note> </p>

<pre>
    class executor {
    public:
        virtual ~executor();
        virtual void add(function&lt;void()> closure) =0;

    };

<cxx-function>
<cxx-signature>executor::~executor()</cxx-signature>
<cxx-Effects> Destroys the executor.</cxx-Effects>
<cxx-Synchronization> All closure initiations happen before the completion of the
executor destructor. <cxx-Note> This means that closure initiations don't leak
past the executor lifetime, and programmers can protect against data races with
the destruction of the environment. There is no guarantee that all closures that
have been added to the executor will execute, only that if a closure executes it
will be initiated before the destructor executes. In some concrete subclasses
the destructor may wait for task completion and in others the destructor may
discard uninitiated tasks.</cxx-Note></cxx-Synchronization>
<cxx-notes> If an executor is destroyed inside a closure running on that executor
object, the behavior is undefined. <cxx-note> one possible behavior is deadlock.

<cxx-Effects> The specified function object shall be scheduled for execution by the
executor at some point in the future. May throw exceptions if add cannot
complete (due to shutdown or other conditions).</cxx-Effects>
<cxx-Synchronization> completion of closure on a particular thread happens before
destruction of that thread's thread-duration variables. <cxx-notes> The consequence
is that closures may use thread-duration variables, but in general such use is
risky. In general executors don't make guarantees about which thread an
individual closure executes in. </cxx-notes></cxx-Synchronization>

inside a series of closures added to an underlying executor in such a way so
that the closures execute serially. For any two closures <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> added to

Class <code>loop_executor</code> is a single-threaded executor that executes closures by

methods may not be called concurrently with each other, but may be called
concurrently with other member functions.
