      <h1>Foreword</h1>

      <p>
        ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a
        worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member
        bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is
        normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each
        member body interested in a subject for which a technical
        committee has been established has the right to be represented
        on that committee. International organizations, governmental
        and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in
        the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
        Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
        electrotechnical standardization.
