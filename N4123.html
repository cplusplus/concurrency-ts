  <h1>Motivation and Goals</h1>
<p>
This document proposes improvements to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4107.html">N4107</a>,
the current Working Draft of the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
The document is motivated by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4032.html">N4032</a>
and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4048.pdf">N4048</a>,
which were presented to SG1 at the Rapperswil meeting. This document collects the parts of these papers that
received positive feedback from SG1 and presents them as a combined set of proposed changes to
the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the paper also addresses some of the issues discovered and reported
to the editor by various individuals, primarily Vicente J. Botet Escriba and Anthony Williams.
</p>
<p>
The author seeks feedback from SG1 on this document. If directed by SG1, all or
some the changes proposed in this document will be incorporated into the next 
Working Paper of the Concurrency TS.
