  <h1>Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Concurrency</h1>
</cxx-titlepage>

<cxx-toc></cxx-toc>

<cxx-clause id="general">
  <h1>General</h1>
  <cxx-section id="general.scope">
    <h1>Scope</h1>

<p>This technical specification describes a number of concurrency extensions to
the C++ Standard Library (<cxx-ref to="general.references"></cxx-ref>). These
extensions are classes and functions that are likely to be used widely within a
program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries written by
different organizations.</p>

<p>This technical specification is non-normative. Some of the library components
in this technical specification may be considered for standardization in a
future version of C++, but they are not currently part of any C++ standard. Some
of the components in this technical specification may never be standardized, and
others may be standardized in a substantially changed form.</p>

<p>The goal of this technical `specification` is to build more
widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard
library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish
to provide them.</p>

  <cxx-section id="general.references">
    <h1>Normative references</h1>

    <p>The following referenced document is indispensable for the
    application of this document. For dated references, only the
    edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition
    of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.</p>

    <ul>

    <p>ISO/IEC 14882:— is herein called the <dfn>C++ Standard</dfn>.
    References to clauses within the C++ Standard are written as "C++14
    &#xa7;3.2". The library described in ISO/IEC 14882:— clauses 17–30 is
    herein called the <dfn>C++ Standard Library</dfn>.</p>

  </cxx-section>

  <cxx-section id="general.namespaces">
    <h1>Namespaces, headers, and modifications to standard classes</h1>

<p> Some of the extensions described in this Technical Specification represent
types and functions that are currently not part of the C++ Standards Library,
and because these extensions are experimental, they should not be declared
directly within namespace <code>std</code>. Instead, such extensions are
declared in namespace <code>std::experimental</code>. <p>

      <cxx-note>
Once standardized, these components are expected to be promoted to namespace <code>std</code>. 
      </cxx-note> <p>

Unless otherwise specified, references to such entities described in this
Technical Specification are assumed to be qualified with
<code>std::experimental</code>, and references to entities described in the C++
Standard Library are assumed to be qualified with <code>std::</code>.
